# Name

Checking in of images

***iavault checkin <options>***

Or

***iavault ci <options>***

ci (short for “check in”; not “co”, which is short for “checkout”)

## Synopsis


iavault checkin [-q | –quiet][--setting=<Option>]

## Description


Checking in of images allows the archive to create a new version of the checked in image. This version will become the latest version and the image that was the latest will become the highest version in the version list. By default the new checked in version will be made read only and become the viewable version of the image and the version any new change will based on.

In some cases the edited image may need to be checked out for more changes, i.e. if the next batch of changes may not go to plan and need to be reversed? By saving the change to a version will allow the reversal of changes back to this place holder version. This can be done by using the uncheck out command.
